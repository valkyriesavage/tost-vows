SAM is standing where the altar would be, if we had one.  Instead, there is a ???? there for him.  Two clusters of people stand on either side of a rather larger-than-usual aisle, but not separated by bride's friends and groom's friends, because that is silly.

The bridesfolk and groomsfolk follow their leaders in from the sides to line up next to SAM.

EVAN parkours in from behind some trees (not sure what the scenery looks like around there yet... presumably we can just set up some picnic tables or something if we're in a jam).

EVAN: Whooeeey, what a day for a wedding!  I can't wait to...

DAVE touches him on the shoulder and gives him the "shush finger".  DAVE points down the aisle.

WEDDING PARTY play Saria's song on their iPhone ocarinas.

VALKYRIE bicycles down the aisle (will this work in the dress?  I dunno.) on a tandem bicycle with DAD riding in front.  They arrive at the place where SAM and EVAN are standing and dismount.

DAD kisses VALKYRIE on the cheeks and passes the bike to GIORGIA to hold.  DAD and VALKYRIE hug.  DAD goes to join the crowd.
